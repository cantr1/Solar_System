        Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. 
        In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the 
        third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times
         the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. 
         Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater 
         mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. The planet 
         orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 AU 
         (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion mi). It is named after the Roman god of the s
         ea and has the astronomical symbol â™†, a stylised version of the god Neptune's 
         trident. Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet 
         in the Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical 
         observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to 
         deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown
          planet. After Bouvard's death, the position of Neptune was predicted from his
        observations, independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier. 
        Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by 
        Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Le Verrier. Its 
        largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the 
        planet's remaining 13 known moons were located telescopically until the 20th 
        century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size,
        making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by 
        Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989; Voyager 2 remains the only 
        spacecraft to visit Neptune. The advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and 
        large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has recently allowed for 
        additional detailed observations from afar.
