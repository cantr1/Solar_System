    <p> Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the 
        Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name 
        of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red Planet".The latter 
        refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives 
        it a reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the 
        naked eye. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, with surface 
        features reminiscent of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts and 
        polar ice caps of Earth. The days and seasons are comparable to those of Earth, 
        because the rotational period as well as the tilt of the rotational axis relative 
        to the ecliptic plane are similar. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest 
        volcano and highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System, and of 
        Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth 
        Borealis basin in the Northern Hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a
         giant impact feature. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small 
         and irregularly shaped. These may be captured asteroids, similar to 5261 
         Eureka, a Mars trojan
