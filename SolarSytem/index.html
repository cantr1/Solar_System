    <h1 id= "Title">Our Solar System</h1>
    <p>The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse 
        of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass 
        is in the Sun, with the majority of the remaining mass contained in Jupiter. 
        The four smaller inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are terrestrial 
        planets, being primarily composed of rock and metal. The four outer planets are 
        giant planets, being substantially more massive than the terrestrials. 
        The two largest planets, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed 
        mainly of hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune, 
        are ice giants, being composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting 
        points compared with hydrogen and helium, called volatiles, such as water, 
        ammonia and methane. All eight planets have almost circular orbits that lie 
        within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic</p>
